## `Django v5 Release` Changes  

Django's history is characterized by its commitment to simplicity, best practices, and robustness. It has evolved to adapt to the changing landscape of web development while maintaining a strong focus on developer productivity and code quality.

> âœ… Python Compatibility  

**Django 5.x** supports Python 3.10, 3.11, and **3.12**. Please note the 4.2.x versions are the last to support Python 3.8 and 3.9.

> âœ… Facet filters in the admin

[Facet](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/filters/?ref=blog.appseed.us#facet-filters) counts are now shown for applied filters in the admin change list when toggled on via the UI. This behavior can be changed via the new [ModelAdmin.show_facets](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/?ref=blog.appseed.us#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.show_facets) attribute.

> âœ… Simplified templates for form field rendering

**Django 5.x** introduces [two new concepts that simplify the rendering](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/?ref=blog.appseed.us#reusable-field-group-templates) of the related elements of a Django form field such as its label, widget, help text, and errors.  

- **field group**
- **field group templates**

> âœ… Database-computed default values

The new field added, [Field.db_default](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/?ref=blog.appseed.us#django.db.models.Field.db_default), parameter sets a database-computed default value.  

> âœ… Database generated model field

The new [GeneratedField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/?ref=blog.appseed.us#django.db.models.GeneratedField) allows the creation of database-generated columns.
